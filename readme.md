# Pymarie
Pymarie is an interpreter built on python for MARIE assembly.

Just put the raw code in a file and run it via the program, i have 2 examples included one made by me and another (very slightly modified) from https://github.com/mathewmariani/MARIE-Examples, you can find many more examples made by Mathew there, a very good resource to learn, please let me know if you find any issues

# Config
The config has two fields:

 - delay: is how long the program waits between each outputs
 - live: if true it shows what the program is doing in real time (showing label and memory assignments)
